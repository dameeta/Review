Problem 1/**Write a program that accepts a number of minutes and converts it both to hours and days.
 * For example, 6000 minutes is 100.0 hours or 4.166666666666667 days.*/

Problem 2/**To encourage good grades, Hermosa High School has decided to award each student a bookstore credit that is 10
 * times the student’s grade point average. In other words, a student with a 3.2 grade point average receives a $32.0 credit.
 * Create an application that prompts a student for a name and grade point average,
 * and then passes the values to a method (computeDiscount) that displays a descriptive message.
 * The message uses the student’s name, echoes the grade point average, and computes and displays the credit, as follows:
 * John, your GPA is 3.4, so your credit is $34.0.*/

Problem 3/**Write a program that accepts the names of three political parties and the number of votes each received in the last mayoral election.
 *  Display the percentage of the vote each party received.*/

Problem 4/**Create a class named Billing that includes three overloaded computeBill() methods for a photo book store.
 * • When computeBill() receives a single parameter, it represents the price of one photo book ordered.
 * Add 8% tax, and return the total due.
 *
 * •When computeBill() receives two parameters, they represent the price of a photo book and the quantity ordered.
 * Multiply the two values, add 8% tax, and return the total due.
 *
 * •When computeBill() receives three parameters, they represent the price of a photo book, the quantity ordered, and a coupon value.
 * Multiply the quantity and price, reduce the result by the coupon value, and then add 8% tax and return the total due.*/
